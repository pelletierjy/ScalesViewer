# ScalesViewer Testing Migration Plans

This directory contains comprehensive plans for migrating the ScalesViewer testing infrastructure from Jest to Vitest and implementing the Screenplay pattern using SerenityJS.

## Plan Documents

### 1. [Migration Plan Overview](migration-plan.md)
Complete overview of the migration strategy with phases, timeline, and success criteria.

### 2. [Vitest Migration Guide](vitest-migration-guide.md)
Detailed step-by-step guide for migrating from Jest to Vitest, including configuration, code changes, and troubleshooting.

### 3. [Jean-Yves Persona Definition](jean-yves-persona.md)
Comprehensive definition of the Jean-Yves expert user persona, including characteristics, usage patterns, and implementation guidelines.

### 4. [SerenityJS Screenplay Implementation](serenityjs-screenplay-implementation.md)
Technical implementation guide for setting up SerenityJS with the Screenplay pattern, including architecture, code examples, and best practices.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Jest to Vitest Migration (2-3 days)
- **Objective**: Replace Jest with Vitest while maintaining all existing functionality
- **Key Deliverables**: All 66 tests passing with Vitest, improved performance, maintained coverage

### Phase 2: SerenityJS & Screenplay Pattern Implementation (3-4 days)
- **Objective**: Set up SerenityJS framework and implement Screenplay pattern
- **Key Deliverables**: Core Screenplay architecture, Jean-Yves persona implementation

### Phase 3: Playwright to Screenplay Conversion (4-5 days)
- **Objective**: Convert existing Playwright tests to Screenplay pattern
- **Key Deliverables**: All E2E tests converted, expert scenarios implemented

### Phase 4: BDD Integration & Feature Files (2-3 days)
- **Objective**: Integrate Cucumber features with Screenplay pattern
- **Key Deliverables**: Enhanced BDD scenarios, expert-level feature files

### Phase 5: Documentation & Training (1-2 days)
- **Objective**: Document the new testing approach and train team
- **Key Deliverables**: Team knowledge transfer, updated guidelines

## Key Benefits

### Technical Benefits
- **Performance**: Vitest offers significantly faster test execution
- **Maintainability**: Screenplay pattern provides better code organization
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different test scenarios
- **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript integration with Vitest

### Testing Benefits
- **Expert Persona**: Jean-Yves enables realistic expert-level testing
- **Natural Language**: Tests read like natural language descriptions
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: SerenityJS provides detailed test reports
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports easy addition of new test scenarios

## Quick Start

1. **Review the Migration Plan Overview** to understand the complete strategy
2. **Start with Vitest Migration** following the detailed guide
3. **Implement SerenityJS Setup** using the Screenplay implementation guide
4. **Reference Jean-Yves Persona** when implementing expert-level tests

## Success Metrics

- All existing tests pass with new frameworks
- Test execution time improved by 50%+
- Code coverage maintained or improved
- Team adoption of new patterns
- Reduced test maintenance overhead

## Risk Mitigation

- Gradual migration approach
- Parallel test execution during transition
- Comprehensive rollback plan
- Regular team communication
