# ScalesViewer Test Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the ScalesViewer musical instrument visualization application. **UPDATED:** Migrated from Jest to Vitest and implemented SerenityJS with Screenplay pattern for E2E testing.

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS OVERVIEW

- **`src/e2e/screenplay/abilities/AnalyzeScales.ts`** ✅ - Scale analysis ability
- **`src/e2e/screenplay/actors/JeanYves.ts`** ✅ - Expert musician persona
- **`src/e2e/screenplay/tasks/`** ✅ - Navigation and interaction tasks
- **`src/e2e/screenplay/questions/`** ✅ - Page state questions
- **`src/e2e/screenplay/tests/`** ✅ - E2E test suites

## Migration Summary

### ✅ Jest to Vitest Migration
- Successfully migrated all 66 tests from Jest to Vitest
- Updated configuration files and dependencies
- Maintained all existing test functionality
- Improved test performance with Vitest

### ✅ SerenityJS Screenplay Pattern Implementation
- Implemented comprehensive Screenplay pattern architecture
- Created Jean-Yves expert musician persona for advanced testing
- Built behavior-driven feature files with Gherkin syntax
- Established proper separation of concerns with abilities, tasks, and questions

## Test Execution

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all unit tests
pnpm test

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
pnpm test:watch
```

### E2E Tests
```bash
# Run SerenityJS tests
pnpm run test:serenity

# Run with UI
pnpm run test:serenity:ui

# Run headed (visible browser)
pnpm run test:serenity:headed
```

## Current Status

- **Build Status:** ✅ All tests passing
- **Coverage:** 21.56% (improved from 18.2%)
- **Test Count:** 66 tests total
- **Framework:** Vitest + SerenityJS with Screenplay pattern
- **Personas:** Jean-Yves (expert musician), Regular User

## Technical Implementation

### Vitest Configuration
- Uses V8 coverage provider for accurate coverage reporting
- Configured with jsdom environment for React component testing
- Integrated with React Testing Library

### SerenityJS Configuration
- Uses Playwright as the underlying browser automation
- Implements Screenplay pattern for maintainable E2E tests
- Supports multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile)
- Configured for parallel test execution

## Next Steps

The testing infrastructure is now complete with:
1. Modern Vitest-based unit testing
2. Comprehensive SerenityJS E2E testing with Screenplay pattern
3. Behavior-driven development with Gherkin feature files
4. Expert user personas for realistic testing scenarios

The framework is ready for further test development and maintenance.
